Hi, Iâ€™m @WammyProductions, better known as Cameron!
Interested in all kinds of programming, the outdoors, and video games.
Currently learning HTML, CSS, JS, and building a website with the HTML5 BoilerPlate Template.
I don't know what I expect from programming yet, just that I really enjoy working on projects!
You can reach me at wammy3224@gmail.com for any kind of inquiries, talk, etc.
